// do while loop does the same thing as for loop and while loop but the syntax is bit different and it is not genrally used in professional work.
// do while loop pseudo code
// initialexpression
// do {
//   code block which has to be executed
// } while(condition)


let i=0;
do {
    console.log("shubhamrout", i);
    i++;
} while(i<=5);

// tsk - print your name 200 times while using do while loop and the iteration will start from 20

let j=20;
do {
    console.log("shubhamrout", j);
    j++;

}while(j<=200);
