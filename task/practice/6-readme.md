<!-- ! what is the flow of the code -->
1. selecting a random number using math.random function and storing it in a variable called randomNumber
2. deciding the computermove by using randomNumber variable
-> if value is between 0 & 1/3 - computerMove is rock
-> if value is between 1/3 & 2/3 - computerMove is paper
-> if value is between 2/3 & 1 - computerMove is scissors
3. defining a variable called result in which we will store our result after after comparing our computermove and playermove which is button we are selecting in this code.
